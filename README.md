# The JavaScript Way Coding Exercises
This is a collection of the various coding exercises from Chapter 1-7 of The JavaScript Way. The following topics were covered under Part I: Learn to code programs:

1. 3, 2, 1... Code!
2. Play with variables
3. Add conditions
4. Repeat statements
5. Write functions
6. Create your first objects
7. Store data in arrays

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I practiced recalling the information and completing all of the exercises in each chapter to further my knowledge of JavaScript. 

## Optimizations

I plan to finish the remaining chapters and complete all exercises in The JavaScript Way.

## Lessons Learned

I experimented with different solutions and console.log() to check my understanding and progress.
